            <p class="My-recipe-in-detailed">Food brings people together on many different levels. It's the nourishment
                of
                the
                soul and body. It's truly
                love. These healthy recipes shake up your comfort food favorites by adding more veggies and swapping out
                cooking methodsâ€”try out pan-fried tilapia next time you're craving fish sticks or our chicken parm
                stuffed
                peppers instead of the heavy pasta-filled dish. For more healthier options, try our healthy lunch and
                breakfast ideas!</p>

                <h2>Avocado Egg</h2>
                <h3 class="orange-color">Insanely Healthy</h3>
                <p>Crack an egg into a bowl, then pour it into the avocado hole. ... The creaminess from the runny egg
                    yolk with the warm, soft avocado is simply a wonderful combination, and it's healthy, too. In fact,
                    people who eat avocados are actually slimmer and thinner than those who don't.</p>

                <h3 class="orange-color">Meet Your Taste Buds</h3>
                <p>The amount of freeze-dried spinach that is added to the noodles is enough to make it green, but
                    that's about it. There isn't enough to provide any nutritional benefits compared to regular pasta.
                    Your decision to eat refined, whole wheat, green, red, long, short or bow-tie noodles won't have
                    much of an effect anyway.</p>

                <p>While prawns contain higher than average amounts of cholesterol, they do not lead to higher
                    cholesterol levels in the body due to their healthy fat profile. This is because they contain
                    almost three times more Omega 3 Fatty Acid than they do Omega 6 Fatty Acid.</p>
