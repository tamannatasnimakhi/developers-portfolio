            <p>Characteristics. Wonder Woman is a compassionate caring, stubborn, opinionated, highly competitive,
                outgoing,
                immortal Amazon. Wonder Woman is a warrior born. She tries to avoid conflict but if pressed she will
                engage
                in battle and on occasion lose herself in the pleasure of battle.</p>

            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>One of the most beloved and iconic DC Super Heroes of all time, Wonder Woman has stood for nearly eighty
                years as a symbol of truth, justice and equality to people everywhere. Raised on the hidden island of
                Themyscira, also known as Paradise Island, Diana is an Amazon, like the figures of Greek legend, and her
                people's gift to humanity.</p>

                <p>Delivered by top-rated instructor, Rob Percival, the tutorials start with the basics of HTML and CSS.
                    You
                    then learn how to make your site interactive with JavaScript and JQuery. In between the lessons,
                    there
                    are quizzes and coding challenges that help to fortify your knowledge. Later on, the course covers
                    design with Bootstrap, coding with MySQL and Python, and how to use APIs (e.g. Google Maps,
                    Twitter).
                    You’ll walk away with real skills and a great portfolio to boot.</p>

                <p>The corporate world can be very daunting or very demanding, especially when you are a fresher. From a
                    comparatively plain sailing journey of a college/university life to a highly competitive working
                    environment, the transition is never easy. Yet I can tell you that getting into the battleground is
                    damn
                    exciting. You get to learn technologies that you might have never heard of, learn stuff from the
                    elites
                    out there and the best of all; you feel important because your code and your effort matters to the
                    company.</p>
